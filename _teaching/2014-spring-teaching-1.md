During **Fall 2024 and Spring 2025**, I worked as a **Teaching Assistant** for the *Theory of Formal Language and Automata* course taught by [**Dr. M. Dolati**](https://sharif.edu/~mdolati/).  

Key contributions:  
- Assisted in creating practice problems and exam questions focused on **deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata (DFA/NFA)**.  
- Supported students through grading and clarifying conceptual difficulties.  
- Helped foster a rigorous learning environment in a foundational theoretical course.
