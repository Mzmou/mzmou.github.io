## Who am I?

I’m **Marziyeh Mousavi**, a rising senior in computer engineering with a strong passion for programming and software systems.

My journey in coding began in high school, where I quickly discovered the excitement of solving problems through code. Since then, I’ve expanded my skills and shared some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mzmou).

My main academic interests include **formal verification**, **model checking**, and **programming languages**, where I enjoy exploring how rigorous methods can improve the reliability of complex systems.

Currently, I serve as a **research assistant** in multiple labs, contributing to projects that aim to design and build more robust and trustworthy computing systems.


## What are my research interests?

My research interests primarily center on **formal verification** and **model checking**. I am also deeply fascinated by related areas such as **programming languages** and **process algebra**.  

I have a strong passion for **formalizing processes in systems** and developing methods to ensure that these processes operate correctly and reliably.


## What are my other interests?

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy **watching movies** and **reading fiction books**.  
I’m also fascinated by **history**, and I’m a big fan of **volleyball**.
